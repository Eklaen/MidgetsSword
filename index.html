                <p>I bid you welcome to the <strong>Midget's Sword</strong>, the first tavern in Eorzea tended by a famous Lalafell adventurer: Arsen Hysen (yes, it's me up there on the painting). The establishment was founded quite recently, but we have at heart to offer you but the very best. We also wish to shed some light on the best Lala fellows out there fighting to protect Eorzea, so check out <a href="./lalafell_of_the_month.html" class="links">our article about the Lalafell of the month</a> each month to know more about your comrades around the world! Some are fighters, some are healers, some are scholars, others are gatherers or crafters, everyone deserves to be under the spotlight!</p>
                <p>The Midget's Sword is located within Empyreum, in the Holy City of Ishgard. We advise people to come at their own discretion and to wear clothes adapted to cold weather and a harsh climate. I will be more than happy to welcome you with a hot beuverage, a lit fire, and a prepared room in order to warm you up.</p>
                <p>If you have any question, the Mogs have set up a strange post system <em><a href="./contact_us.html" class="links">here</a></em>, so go ahead, and I will write you back as soon as possible!</p>
