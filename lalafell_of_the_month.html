                    <p>Our first article will be about Alt'ar Eir, a mysterious battle medic roaming the battlefields trying to help the wounded. He studied the art of the Sages to better help others. He was selected to be the Lalafell of the month thanks to his talents but also his... hum... <em>coldness</em> which is relevant in December, isn't it?</p>

                    <p>Alt'ar is a cold, bitter, arrogant and haughty Plainsfolk Lalafell but deep within lies a proud being. He comes from Gridania and mainly works for the Maelstrom. He wishes to be the very best at helping others. He has spent a long time studying medicine and various healing methods and how to apply them directly on the battlefield in the heat of battle to better his arts. On the one hand, Alt'ar is torn between going to Sharlayan so as to start a thesis and share his vast knowledge with others. On the other hand, he does not wish to leave the wounded behind and risk losing patients while being in Sharlayan.</p>
                    
                    <p>To put it in a nutshell, he deserved to be put under the spotlight for our first portrait since despite his cold personality and somewhat strange nature, we <strong>know</strong> he has got a big heart and he has spent so much much time helping others that we wanted to help him find some companionship and make some partnership around Eorzea. So if you see him in our tavern, do not hesitate and go ahead! Talk to him, we promise he will not bite (perhaps he will try though!)!</p>
